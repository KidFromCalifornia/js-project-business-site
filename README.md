Midnight Matinee is a fictional webstore created for the Techingo Dev Boot Camp in spring 2025. The store is designed to sell reproduction monster posters from the golden age of cinema. 

The design features a responsive layout that incorporates flexbox and grid systems, along with animations. It includes various forms, such as checkboxes, dropdowns, and a signup form. 

In the mobile view, the navigation bar has a hamburger menu that operates with the help of JavaScript. If you click around, you might even discover a fun surprise!
